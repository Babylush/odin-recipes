    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>In the vibrant streets of Korea there exists a sandwich that can tickle your tastebuds. </p><p> 
    Fortunately for you, the recipe is quite simple and the end result is bliss</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>1 cup thinly sliced green cabbage</li>
        <li>1/3 cup julienned carrot</li>
        <li>1 stalk green onion,thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons salted butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 thick slices white bread</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 thin slices smoked ham</li>
        <li>1 slice mild cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>

        <li>Mix cabbage, carrot, green onion, salt, pepper, and cayenne with your hands in a bowl until soft, about 30 seconds. Mix in eggs with a fork until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add bread slices and flip a few times to make sure both sides are coated with butter. Grill bread until beautifully toasted, golden brown, and a little crispy on both sides. Transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Add cabbage mixture; cook and simultaneously mix by using the edge of a spatula to chop down on the surface while pushing the edges up and over the top. As the mixture starts to hold its shape, form it into a rectangle that's about twice as long as it is wide. Split the rectangle in half into two square patties; continue to cook until golden brown, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Stack patties on top of one another onto one slice of toast and sprinkle with sugar.</li>
        <li>Place ham slices into the hot skillet; cook over medium heat until sizzling, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and top with Cheddar slice; cook until melted, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Place ham and cheese on top of patties; top with ketchup, mayonnaise, and remaining slice of toast. Cut in half and serve.</li>

    </ol>
